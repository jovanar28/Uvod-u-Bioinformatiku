# Homework 1
Genetic Data Analysis

## Task Overview

The provided VCF file contains results from a population study on genetic mutations.  
Subjects affected by a disease are labeled as `case_x`, and healthy individuals as `control_x`.
The goal is to extract, visualize, and statistically analyze these mutations to identify those associated with the disease.

## Subtasks:
- Count and summarize participants and mutations
- Visualize mutation characteristics using histograms
- Apply chi-square tests to identify disease-associated mutations
- Create a Manhattan plot to visualize p-values across the genome
- Evaluate Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for significant mutations
- Use UCSC Genome Browser and OMIM to identify genes related to top mutations
